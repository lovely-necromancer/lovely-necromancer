- 👋 Hi, I’m @lovely-necromancer (earth-name: Shahriar Ebrahimi)
- 🧐 I'm a Research Fellow @ University of Warwick, UK, and also a Founding Memeber @ [Zero Savvy](https://github.com/zero-savvy).
- 🪱 I'm focusing right now on [@worm-privacy](https://github.com/worm-privacy) and 🔥[@incendia](https://github.com/zero-savvy/burn-to-vote).
- 🧐 Previously, I was an RA at Newcastle University, and prior to that a PostDoc at IDEAS-NCBR, Warsaw, Poland. I've got my PhD in Computer Engineering in 2021. My thesis was focused on Lattice-based Cryptography.
- 👀 I’m interested in cryptography, especially: zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), multi-party computation (MPC), and Computational Fuzzy Extractors (CFE).
- 🌱 I’m currently involved in @Zero-Savvy.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaboratation on any project that tries to revolutionize centralized architectures with MPC/ZKP/Blockchain technologies.
